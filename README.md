## Hi there 👋

<!-- **c-zhenhao/c-zhenhao** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- 🤔 I’m a former investment research analyst who has successfully switched to software engineering. Always looking for help with full-stack development to better my craft so I can build meaningful stuff.

- 🥞 I have some experience working on the following stacks: 
    - ReactNative, Next.js (TS), Go, CockroachDB, Redis, MongoDB (current stack @ work), Snowflake, AWS, Firebase, Swift (for iOS dev), Kotlin/Java (for Android dev)
    - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
    - Python, Django, PostgreSQL

- 🌱 I’m currently brushing up on Data Structures & Algos! My work alter-ego is a QA engineer 😆

- 📝 Planning to learn (plz send me tips/guides):
    - More GCP related functionalities, Angular(TS)
    - AWS: S3, SQS, ELK, ECS
    - Blockchain langs: Solidity, Rust
    - Containers: Docker + Kubernetes
    - Python stuff: Flask for API, other python packages for ML stuff (not super high prio)
    - API: GraphQL, gRPC
    - Other stuff: Socket.IO

- 💬 Ask me about anything!
